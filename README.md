projects were built with help from a platformer tutorial we found on youtube 
2D platformer controller(Unity 5) by Sebastian Lague

Initially in the first folder named citrus_hack we attempted to build on top our own 
physics concept which involved rotating platforms and a rotating main world, but we quickly 
ran into problems.

Instead we decided to simplify and make things more linear as seen
in the second folder named citrus_hack2. We focused the remainder of our time
working on the sprite art and animation of the character.
